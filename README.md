## INFO 201 Project Proposal
By: Phung Phu, Renee Wang, Xuhua Zou, Kyle Lawrence

## Project Description

#### Our Datasets
We will be looking at a data set containing information on [Spotify's Worldwide Daily Song Ranking](https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking)
from 2016 to 2018. This data set was originally created by Eduardo, a software
engineer at BlaBlaCar.  In addition to that data set, we will also be using the
[Top Spotify Tracks of 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-spotify-tracks-of-2018)
dataset that gives us information about the audio features of the top Spotify songs in 2018.
This data set was created by Nadin Tamer, who gathered information about the descriptions
of the audio features from the Spotify API. By using both datasets, this will allow
us to provide the most popular song in a region and the audio features of the most
popular songs.


#### Intended Audience
Our primary target audience is music listeners who are interested in the audio features of
songs and want to know more about the song....
